A list of prototyping tools

This list is split into the following categories:
+ High Fedility Tools
+ Mockup tools

The difference is that the high fedility tools can create much more "realistic" looking versions of software while the mockup software can not. 

This list is meant to be exhaustive, not a comment on quality. If you see anything missing, please contribute.
